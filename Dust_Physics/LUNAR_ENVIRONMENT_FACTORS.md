# Environmental Factors Affecting LDM Performance

The performance of a passive, long-duration dust rounding system depends on the lunar environment surrounding it. This file summarizes the major environmental influences.

## 1. Vacuum Environment

With no atmosphere:
- particles do not undergo fluid drag  
- motion stops only through collision or electrostatic attraction  
- heat transfer is primarily radiative  

This amplifies:
- electrostatic effects  
- abrasion-based interactions

## 2. Extreme Temperature Cycles

Day-night cycles range from:
- +120°C daytime  
- –170°C nighttime  

Thermal impacts:
- electrode performance  
- material expansion  
- electrical yield  
- dust charge state  

The LDM’s passive operation mitigates these through:
- low thermal stress components  
- autonomous night-mode energy buffering

## 3. Natural Dust Mobility

Dust moves due to:
- astronaut activity  
- rovers and foot traffic  
- lander exhaust plumes  
- micro-lofting near terminators  

This provides a constant *input stream* of particles into the LDM’s vicinity.

## 4. Local Surface Topography

Placement near habitats maximizes:
- footstep-induced particle clouds  
- tool cleaning events  
- operations-based dust motion  

Small slopes or depressions funnel dust into the system over time.

## 5. Solar Wind and UV Exposure

These drive:
- surface charging  
- adhesion cycles  
- hopping particle behavior  

The LDM leverages naturally charged dust for enhanced chamber activity.

## 6. Longevity and Multi-Decadal Operation

The LDM is intentionally:
- passive  
- slow-acting  
- cumulative  
- durable  

Decades-long rounding gradually reshapes the immediate operational environment.
