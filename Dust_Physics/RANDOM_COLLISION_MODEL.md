# Random Collision Model for Dust Rounding

The LDM’s O-Machine chamber increases dust–dust collisions through controlled, non-directed electrostatic agitation. This is a statistical process relying on high-frequency, low-energy interactions rather than mechanical forcing.

## 1. System Concept

Dust grains inside the chamber are exposed to:
- randomized electrostatic pulses  
- multi-directional force vectors  
- intermittent attractive and repulsive fields  

Unlike vortex or swirl designs, the LDM does **not** depend on coherent fluid motion. Instead, it uses “popcorn-like” agitation: particles hop, collide, and settle in unpredictable patterns.

## 2. Collision Frequency Model

Dust collision rate R is approximated by:

**R ≈ n · σ · v_rel**

Where:
- **n** = effective particle density in chamber  
- **σ** = collision cross-section (particle radii + morphology)  
- **v_rel** = relative velocity induced by electrostatic pulses  

Electrostatic pulses increase **v_rel** by:
- inducing micro-jumps  
- generating brief repulsion bursts  
- destabilizing resting configurations

## 3. Edge-Dulling Mechanism

Every collision is essentially:
- brittle fracture  
- grain chipping  
- micro-abrasion against other particles  

Repeated over millions of cycles, this leads to:
- rounded contours  
- reduced asperities  
- lower edge radius variance  

No single collision matters; the cumulative distribution does.

## 4. Statistical Nature

The model resembles:
- granular media agitation  
- Brownian-like driven randomness  
- high-cycle fatigue applied to morphology  

Even extremely low per-collision wear rates become meaningful over:
- months  
- years  
- decades

## 5. Failure Modes Considered

Potential issues include:
- insufficient particle density (reduced n)  
- electrostatic pulse decay over time  
- wall adhesion reducing active particle count  
- power deficits limiting pulse frequency  

Mitigations:
- self-cleaning front electrode  
- periodic pulse flush cycles  
- environmental dust feed from surface operations

## 6. Purpose

This model provides the theoretical justification for expecting long-term, cumulative rounding from purely passive and low-power agitation processes.
