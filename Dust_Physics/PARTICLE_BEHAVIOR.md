# Particle Behavior of Lunar Regolith

Lunar regolith behaves unlike terrestrial dust due to its origin, morphology, and the absence of atmospheric weathering. These factors produce highly abrasive, electrostatically active particles that present long-term operational hazards for equipment, habitats, suits, and optical systems.

## 1. Morphology and Sharpness

Lunar dust particles are created by micrometeoroid impacts and ejecta fragmentation rather than erosion or chemical weathering. As a result:

- Edges are **angular, sharp, and irregular**.
- Grains display **fracture planes**, not smoothed contours.
- Surface roughness increases the number of contact points during abrasion.

The abrasive nature results in accelerated wear on:
- visor coatings  
- joint bearings  
- seals and gasket materials  
- thermal blankets  
- solar panel cover glass

## 2. Micro-Abrasiveness

Under foot traffic, rover wheels, or mechanical disturbances, particles embed into softer materials and act as micro-cutting agents.

Research indicates:
- Abrasion damage correlates strongly with **edge radius** of grains.
- Even small reductions in sharpness produce **disproportionate** reductions in wear.

## 3. Electrostatic Adhesion

Lunar dust accumulates electric charge from:
- solar UV radiation  
- solar wind plasma  
- triboelectric contact with suits, tools, and habitats  

This charging causes grains to:
- cling to surfaces
- jump between materials
- remain suspended in local “mini-lofting” zones

Adhesion strength varies with:
- composition (basaltic vs highland)
- grain size distribution
- illumination angle  
- local electric fields

## 4. Lofting and Re-Deposition

Even without an atmosphere, charged grains can briefly loft and re-settle. This motion ensures that sharp particles continuously migrate onto surfaces that would otherwise remain clean.

## 5. Relevance to the LDM System

The Lunar Dust Mitigator operates by reducing:
- particle edge sharpness  
- aggregate surface roughness  
- electrostatic re-adhesion probability  

Over multi-year operation, cumulative rounding of particles yields:
- lower abrasion rates  
- lower static cling  
- safer long-term surface operations
