# Electrostatic Adhesion and Charge Dynamics in Lunar Dust

Electrostatic behavior dominates dust–surface interactions on the Moon due to vacuum conditions, high UV flux, and the absence of atmospheric discharge pathways.

## 1. Charge Accumulation Mechanisms

Particles accumulate charge from:
- **Photoemission** under UV exposure  
- **Solar wind electron/proton flux**  
- **Triboelectric interactions** with tools, suits, and habitat surfaces  

In vacuum, charges persist significantly longer than on Earth.

## 2. Adhesion Physics

Adhesion forces include:
- Van der Waals interactions  
- Coulomb attraction  
- Mechanical interlocking of sharp edges  

Coulomb forces, while weak individually, become dominant when:
- particle mass is extremely small  
- surface area-to-mass ratios are high  
- local fields are uneven  
- surfaces are insulating

## 3. Dust Sticking to Equipment

Adhesion causes:
- coating of visors  
- clogging of radiators  
- reduction of reflectivity  
- contamination of instrumentation  
- interference with mechanical joints  

Even brief EVA activity can result in measurable dust accumulation.

## 4. Influence of Electrostatic Environment

Local electric fields vary with:
- solar elevation  
- terrain shadows  
- transitions between sunlight and darkness  
- surface material composition  

Field inversion can cause particles to jump or “hop.”

## 5. Relevance to LDM Operation

By inducing controlled electrostatic pulses within the chamber:
- adhesion → becomes a transport mechanism  
- dust is pulled off surfaces  
- dust self-enters collision cycles  
- particles detach from walls through repulsion  

The LDM *uses* adhesion to its advantage instead of fighting it.

## 6. Long-Term Effect

Reduced sharpness decreases:
- adhesive strength  
- surface cling probability  
- risk of long-term accumulation on sensitive systems
