# Renders & Dimensional Specification Package  
### Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM) — Visualization & Engineering Reference

This folder contains all renders, dimensional views, and visual specification materials for the Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM).  
These assets provide a detailed visual understanding of the system geometry, deployment posture, key interfaces, and component layout.

---

## 📐 1. Purpose of This Folder
Renders and dimensional diagrams are provided to:

- Clarify the external and internal geometry of the LDM  
- Support engineering review, prototyping, and academic evaluation  
- Provide visual references for mission planners and integration teams  
- Assist with manufacturability assessment, tolerance modeling, and scaling decisions  

This folder acts as the **visual companion** to the technical report and schematics.

):

- **Isometric renders**  
- **Front / Side / Top orthographic views**  
- **Exploded views** (if applicable)  
- **Subsystem dimensional snapshots**  
- **Key interface dimensions** (mounting feet, tank brackets, ejector clearance, etc.)

## 📏 3. Dimensional Conventions
All dimensions follow:

- **SI units (primary)**  
- **Millimeters** for small components  
- **Centimeters** or **meters** for overall assembly views  

All reference dimensions are approximate unless labeled **CRITICAL**.

## 🚀 4. Notes for Reviewers
- These renders are **visual aids, not CAD manufacturing drawings**.  
- For engineering teams wishing to fabricate prototypes, contact the inventor for CAD access or collaboration under the standard Kaizen 3% Royalty Commercial License.  
- Updated renders will be added as the system matures.
