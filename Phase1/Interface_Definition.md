# LDM — Phase 1 Interface Definition

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **external interfaces** used during Phase 1 testing of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) test article.

Interfaces are defined solely to:
- Enable testing
- Prevent ambiguity
- Avoid unintended system ownership or integration claims

All interfaces described here are **non-flight, non-operational, and temporary**.

---

## Interface Philosophy (Phase 1)

Phase 1 interfaces follow these rules:

- Simple
- External
- Manually controlled where possible
- Clearly bounded

No Phase 1 interface implies compatibility with flight systems, lunar infrastructure, or operational architectures.

## Electrical Interface (If Applicable)

### Power Input

- Power source: External laboratory power supply
- Voltage: **[TBD] V** (defined prior to testing)
- Current limit: Set by test operator
- Connector type: Non-flight laboratory connectors or terminals

Power delivery is:
- Open-loop
- Manually controlled
- Not fault-tolerant

No onboard power storage is required.
