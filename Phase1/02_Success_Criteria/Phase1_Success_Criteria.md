# LDM — Phase 1 Success Criteria

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **minimum measurable outcomes** required for the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) concept to be considered **viable enough to justify further study**.

Phase 1 success criteria are intentionally limited in scope. They do not represent operational requirements, flight requirements, or lunar surface performance targets.

All criteria in this document are **binary**: pass or fail.

---

## Primary Success Objective

The primary objective of Phase 1 is to demonstrate that the LDM mechanism produces a **measurable, repeatable effect on dust behavior** under controlled test conditions.

If this objective is not met, the concept is considered **non-viable** for continuation.

---

## Success Criteria Overview

Phase 1 success is evaluated across four categories:

1. Dust Interaction Effectiveness  
2. Repeatability  
3. Power and Thermal Acceptability  
4. Mechanical Survivability During Testing  

Failure in any category constitutes Phase 1 failure.

---

## 1. Dust Interaction Effectiveness

### SC-1.1 — Measurable Dust Reduction or Redirection

Under defined test conditions, the LDM test article must demonstrate at least one of the following:

- A **≥ 20% reduction** in measured airborne dust concentration within a defined test volume, **or**
- A **≥ 20% reduction** in dust deposition rate on a defined witness surface, **or**
- A clearly measurable and repeatable **redirection of dust flow** away from a defined protected region

Measurement method, sensor placement, and averaging window are defined in the Measurement & Instrumentation document.

**Pass:** Threshold met or exceeded  
**Fail:** No statistically distinguishable effect observed  

---

### SC-1.2 — Particle Size Relevance

The observed dust interaction must include particles within at least one of the following size bands (or equivalent simulant ranges):

- Fine dust (< 20 µm), **or**
- Medium dust (20–100 µm)

Demonstrating effect only on large particulates (> 100 µm) is insufficient for Phase 1 success.

---

## 2. Repeatability

### SC-2.1 — Repeatable Effect

The dust interaction effect defined in SC-1 must be repeatable across **at least three test runs** under nominally identical conditions.

**Pass:** Effect observed in ≥ 2 out of 3 runs  
**Fail:** Effect appears only once or inconsistently  

This criterion explicitly allows for experimental noise and setup variability.

---

## 3. Power and Thermal Acceptability

### SC-3.1 — Power Envelope Compliance

During Phase 1 testing, the LDM test article must operate within a **bounded power envelope** defined prior to testing.

Indicative target (not a flight requirement):
- Peak power draw ≤ **X W**
- Average power draw ≤ **Y W**

Exact values are defined before test execution and documented in test logs.

**Pass:** Power remains within defined bounds  
**Fail:** Sustained or repeated excursions beyond bounds  

---

### SC-3.2 — Thermal Stability During Test Cycles

During operation, the test article must not exhibit:

- Uncontrolled temperature rise
- Thermal runaway
- Structural damage attributable to thermal effects

Measured temperatures must remain within material-safe limits for the duration of each test run.

**Pass:** Stable thermal behavior observed  
**Fail:** Thermal instability or damage  

---

## 4. Mechanical Survivability

### SC-4.1 — No Irreversible Mechanical Failure

Across all Phase 1 test runs, the test article must not experience:

- Permanent deformation that alters intended geometry
- Irreversible clogging that prevents further testing
- Structural failure requiring rebuild between runs

Routine cleaning or reset between runs is permitted.

**Pass:** Test article remains functional across runs  
**Fail:** Irrecoverable mechanical failure  

---

## Explicit Non-Criteria

The following are **not** success criteria for Phase 1 and are intentionally excluded:

- Long-duration endurance
- Continuous unattended operation
- Lunar gravity performance
- Lunar vacuum or radiation survivability
- Crew safety certification
- Dust mitigation to regulatory or operational thresholds
- Scalability or array behavior
- Integration readiness

Failure to demonstrate any of the above does **not** constitute Phase 1 failure.

---

## Phase 1 Outcome Interpretation

- **Phase 1 Success**: All required criteria above are met  
- **Phase 1 Failure**: One or more required criteria are not met  

Phase 1 success indicates only that the concept warrants further investigation.  
Phase 1 failure indicates that the concept should be revised or abandoned.

No other interpretation is valid.
