# LDM — Phase 1 Explicit Exclusions

## Purpose of This Document

This document explicitly defines what **Phase 1 of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) project does NOT include, imply, or authorize**.

It exists to prevent:
- Scope creep
- Misinterpretation by reviewers
- Accidental claims beyond Phase 1
- Unintended downstream obligations

If a capability is not explicitly included in Phase 1 documentation, it is excluded by default.

---

## Operational Exclusions

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

- Lunar surface deployment
- Field operation on the Moon
- Operation in lunar gravity or true lunar vacuum
- Exposure to lunar radiation or micrometeoroids
- Long-duration or continuous operation
- Survival across lunar day/night cycles
- Autonomous operation or decision-making
- Remote or unattended operation

No Phase 1 result should be interpreted as evidence of operational readiness.

---

## System and Integration Exclusions

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

- Integration with landers, rovers, or habitats
- Integration with crewed systems
- Compatibility with existing lunar infrastructure
- Networked or multi-unit operation
- Interfacing with power grids or data buses
- Deployment, anchoring, or mobility systems

The LDM Phase 1 test article is not a system-of-systems component.

---

## Performance and Scaling Exclusions

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

- Performance optimization
- Efficiency optimization
- Scalability claims
- Array behavior or coverage modeling
- Lifetime or reliability estimation
- Maintenance or serviceability assumptions
- Production or manufacturing readiness

No scaling behavior is implied by Phase 1 results.

---

## Environmental Fidelity Exclusions

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

- High-fidelity lunar regolith simulation
- Electrostatic dust charging representative of solar wind
- Reduced-gravity dust dynamics
- Thermal-vacuum cycling
- Abrasion or erosion over mission lifetimes

Environmental realism is intentionally deferred.

---

## Certification and Readiness Exclusions

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

- Flight qualification
- Safety certification
- Human-rating considerations
- TRL advancement beyond early laboratory validation
- Compliance with spaceflight standards

Phase 1 does not establish TRL beyond early concept validation.

---

## Future Phase Non-Implication

Phase 1 completion does **not**:

- Commit the project to Phase 2 or later work
- Guarantee feasibility in operational environments
- Imply funding readiness
- Imply schedule or cost projections

Any future phase requires explicit redefinition and authorization.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If a capability, environment, or claim is not explicitly documented as **included** in Phase 1, it is **excluded by default**.

This rule overrides informal discussion, external interpretation, or implied assumptions.

---

## Summary

Phase 1 LDM is intentionally narrow.

It tests whether a dust-mitigation concept works at all under controlled conditions.

Nothing more is claimed.
