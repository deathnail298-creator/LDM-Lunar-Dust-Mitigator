# LDM — Phase 1 Scope & Non-Claims

## Purpose of Phase 1

Phase 1 of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) system exists for **permission to test**, not permission to deploy.

The sole purpose of Phase 1 is to validate, under controlled laboratory or analog conditions, whether the core LDM dust-mitigation mechanism produces a **measurable, repeatable reduction in dust presence** within defined bounds of power, thermal behavior, and physical survivability.

Phase 1 does **not** establish flight readiness, operational readiness, or suitability for lunar surface deployment.

---

## What Phase 1 *Is*

Phase 1 includes **only** the following activities:

- Fabrication of a **bounded physical test article** representative of the LDM concept
- Bench-top, laboratory, or analog testing under controlled conditions
- Measurement of dust interaction, dust reduction, or dust redirection effects
- Measurement of power draw and thermal behavior during testing
- Identification of failure modes and operational limits
- Determination of whether the concept is viable enough to justify further study

Phase 1 results are intended to answer a single question:

> *Does the LDM concept demonstrably affect dust in a useful way under test conditions, without unacceptable power, thermal, or mechanical failure?*

---

## What Phase 1 *Is Not*

Phase 1 explicitly does **not** include:

- Lunar surface deployment or field trials  
- Operation in true lunar vacuum, radiation, or temperature cycles  
- Long-duration or continuous operation  
- Autonomous navigation, control, or decision-making  
- Integration with crewed systems or habitats  
- Integration with landers, rovers, or launch infrastructure  
- Multi-unit coordination or networked behavior  
- Reliability, lifetime, or maintenance claims  
- Manufacturing readiness or cost optimization  

Any interpretation of Phase 1 results beyond laboratory or analog validation is invalid.

## System Boundaries (Phase 1)

For Phase 1, the LDM system boundary is strictly limited to:

- The physical dust-mitigation mechanism under test
- Immediate supporting structure required to hold geometry
- External power supplied by laboratory equipment (if applicable)
- External measurement and logging equipment

The following are **outside the system boundary** and are treated as external or mocked:

- Flight-representative power systems
- Flight-representative thermal control
- Environmental sealing or packaging
- Deployment mechanisms
- Mobility systems
- Autonomy or software control logic

---

## Non-Claims (Explicit)

The following claims are **explicitly not made** by Phase 1 results:

- That LDM works on the Moon
- That LDM survives lunar night
- That LDM is compatible with any specific mission architecture
- That LDM reduces dust to any operational or regulatory threshold
- That LDM scales linearly or favorably with size or quantity
- That LDM is safe for crewed proximity
- That LDM is cost-effective at production scale

Phase 1 results **must not** be cited as evidence for operational deployment.

---

## Relationship to Phase 0 and Future Phases

- Phase 0 defined the **problem framing, rationale, and conceptual architecture**
- Phase 1 tests **only the minimum physical validity** of that concept
- Any Phase 2 or later activity would require:
  - New scope definition
  - New success criteria
  - New system boundaries
  - Explicit authorization

No future phase is implied or guaranteed by the existence of Phase 1 results.

---

## Summary (Non-Interpretive)

Phase 1 LDM is a **contained, falsifiable test effort**.

Success means the concept shows measurable promise under defined test conditions.  
Failure means the concept does not justify further investment.

Nothing more is claimed.
