1. Phase 1 Scope Lock (Non-Negotiable)

You need a clearly labeled Phase 1 section (README or /Phase1/README.md) that states, explicitly:

Phase 1 is lab / analog testing only

No lunar deployment claims

No long-duration ops

No autonomous decision escalation

No production scaling

No integration into other systems beyond test interfaces
