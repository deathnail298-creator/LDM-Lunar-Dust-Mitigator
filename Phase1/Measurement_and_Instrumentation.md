# LDM — Phase 1 Measurement and Instrumentation

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **minimum instrumentation and measurement methods** used to evaluate Phase 1 performance of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) test article.

Instrumentation is selected for **clarity, repeatability, and practicality**, not flight representativeness or precision beyond Phase 1 needs.

Measurements are intended to determine whether a **measurable effect exists**, not to fully characterize performance.

---

## Measurement Philosophy (Phase 1)

Phase 1 measurement follows these principles:

- Prefer simple, well-understood methods
- Accept known error and uncertainty
- Measure relative change rather than absolute perfection
- Avoid instrumentation that adds complexity or risk to the test article

Instrumentation is treated as **external test equipment**, not part of the LDM system.

---

## Dust Measurement

### 1. Airborne Dust Concentration (Optional)

Airborne dust concentration may be measured using one or more of the following:

- Optical particle counters
- Light-scattering sensors
- Optical imaging with post-test analysis

Measurements are taken:
- Within a defined test volume
- Before LDM activation (baseline)
- During and/or after LDM operation

Reported values represent **relative change** from baseline, not absolute environmental truth.

---

### 2. Dust Deposition Measurement (Primary)

Dust deposition may be measured using:

- Witness plates or surfaces placed in defined locations
- Gravimetric measurement (mass before vs after test)
- Optical coverage or obscuration analysis

Witness surfaces are:
- Fixed in position
- Cleaned or replaced between test runs
- Documented with photographs when applicable

Deposition rate reduction is reported as a percentage relative to baseline tests.

---

### 3. Qualitative Observation

The following qualitative observations are permitted and documented:

- Visual dust flow patterns
- Accumulation zones
- Redirection away from protected regions
- Onset of clogging or buildup

Qualitative observations are **supplementary** and do not replace quantitative measurements.

---

## Power Measurement

If the LDM test article requires power:

- Power is supplied via external laboratory equipment
- Voltage and current are logged using:
  - Bench power supplies
  - Inline power meters
  - Data acquisition equipment (if available)

Recorded parameters include:
- Peak power draw
- Average power draw during operation
- Duration of operation per test

Power measurements are used solely to verify **bounded operation**, not efficiency optimization.

---

## Thermal Measurement

Thermal behavior is monitored to ensure safe operation.

Permitted methods include:
- Thermocouples
- Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)
- Infrared thermography (spot or qualitative)

Temperature sensors are placed at:
- Representative high-risk locations
- Structural or material interfaces
- Any region suspected of heat buildup

Thermal data is used to identify instability or damage risk, not to model lunar thermal behavior.

---

## Data Logging and Recording

Phase 1 data collection may include:

- Manual logs
- Spreadsheet-based recording
- Simple time-stamped digital logs

High-frequency or automated logging is **not required**.

All data is retained with:
- Test configuration identifier
- Date and time
- Environmental conditions
- Notes on anomalies or deviations

---

## Measurement Uncertainty and Limitations

Phase 1 measurements acknowledge:

- Sensor accuracy limitations
- Setup-dependent variability
- Dust behavior stochasticity

Results are interpreted using:
- Averaging across multiple runs
- Comparison to baseline tests
- Conservative conclusions

Absence of high-precision instrumentation does **not** invalidate Phase 1 results.

---

## Explicit Non-Measurement Claims

Phase 1 measurements do **not** claim to provide:

- Flight-quality data
- Lunar environmental fidelity
- Long-term performance statistics
- Certification-level accuracy

No Phase 1 measurement should be cited as proof of operational readiness.

---

## Summary

Measurement and instrumentation in Phase 1 exist to answer a single question:

> *Does the LDM concept produce a measurable, repeatable effect under controlled conditions?*

Anything beyond that is intentionally excluded.
