# LDM — Phase 1 Test Article Definition

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **exact physical test article** used for Phase 1 validation of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) concept.

The intent is to eliminate ambiguity regarding what was built, what was tested, and what conclusions may be drawn from the results.

Anything not explicitly defined here is **out of scope** for Phase 1.

---

## Test Article Overview

The Phase 1 LDM test article is a **single, non-flight, non-deployable physical unit** constructed solely to evaluate the dust-mitigation mechanism under laboratory or analog conditions.

The test article is **not** a prototype of a deployable lunar system.  
It is a **representative mechanism demonstrator**.

---

## Physical Configuration

### Geometry

- Overall form factor: fixed, rigid geometry
- Geometry is **static** during testing (no articulation, deployment, or reconfiguration)
- Dimensions:
  - Bounding box: approximately **[TBD] cm × [TBD] cm × [TBD] cm**
  - Dimensional tolerances: ± **[TBD]%**
- Orientation during testing is fixed or manually set

Any deviation from this geometry during testing is considered a new test article.

---

### Mass Properties

- Total mass: **[TBD] kg** (± **[TBD]%**)
- Mass distribution is not flight-representative
- Center of mass location is not controlled beyond test stability needs

Mass values are documented to ensure repeatability, not to imply deployability.

---

## Materials

The test article is constructed from **commercially available materials** suitable for laboratory testing.

Permitted materials include:
- Aluminum
- Steel
- Polymers (e.g., ABS, nylon)
- Composite or additive-manufactured parts
- Laboratory fasteners and fixtures

Materials are selected for:
- Mechanical stability
- Thermal tolerance during testing
- Ease of fabrication

No claim is made regarding:
- Radiation hardness
- Vacuum compatibility
- Long-term durability
- Lunar regolith abrasion survivability

---

## Dust-Mitigation Mechanism (Under Test)

The following elements are considered **core** to the Phase 1 test article:

- The dust-interaction geometry or surface(s)
- Any passive or active mechanism directly responsible for altering dust behavior
- Any fixed-field, flow, or geometry-based interaction region

These elements are **representative of the conceptual LDM architecture** as defined in Phase 0.

The following are **not** required to be flight-representative:
- Surface finishes
- Coatings
- Structural packaging
- Redundancy or fault tolerance

---

## Power Implementation (Phase 1)

- Power, if required, is supplied externally via laboratory equipment
- No onboard power storage is required
- No power conditioning or fault management is required beyond test safety

Power interfaces are temporary and non-representative.

---

## Thermal Implementation (Phase 1)

- No active thermal control is required
- Thermal behavior is monitored only to ensure:
  - Safe operation during testing
  - Absence of thermal runaway or damage

No attempt is made to simulate lunar thermal environments.

---

## Control and Operation

- Test article operation is:
  - Manual, or
  - Open-loop, or
  - Simple bench-controlled

No autonomous logic, decision-making, or software control is included in Phase 1.

---

## Mocked or Externalized Subsystems

The following subsystems are **explicitly externalized or mocked** during Phase 1:

- Power generation and storage
- Environmental sealing
- Structural mounting to lunar surface
- Mobility or deployment mechanisms
- Communications systems
- Autonomy or navigation

Performance or absence of these subsystems has **no bearing** on Phase 1 outcomes.

---

## Configuration Control

- The Phase 1 test article configuration is fixed for the duration of testing
- Any modification beyond cleaning or minor repair constitutes:
  - A new configuration, and
  - A new test series

All configurations are documented prior to test execution.

---

## Explicit Non-Claims

The Phase 1 test article does **not** claim to represent:

- A flight article
- A deployable system
- A scalable design
- A manufacturable product
- A lunar-qualified structure

It exists solely to test whether the **LDM dust-interaction concept** exhibits measurable effect under controlled conditions.

---

## Summary

The Phase 1 LDM test article is a **bounded, deliberately incomplete physical embodiment** of the LDM concept.

Its purpose is to enable falsifiable testing.  
Nothing more is implied.
