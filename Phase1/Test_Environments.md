# LDM — Phase 1 Test Environments

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **allowed and disallowed test environments** for Phase 1 validation of the Lunar Dust Mitigation (LDM) concept.

Phase 1 environments are intentionally simplified. They exist to enable **controlled, repeatable, falsifiable testing**, not environmental fidelity.

No Phase 1 test environment is claimed to represent the lunar surface.

---

## Allowed Test Environments (Phase 1)

Phase 1 testing may be conducted in one or more of the following environments.

### 1. Ambient Laboratory Environment

- Pressure: Ambient atmospheric pressure
- Gravity: Earth gravity (1 g)
- Temperature: Typical indoor laboratory range
- Airflow: Quiescent or controlled airflow as required by test setup

This environment is acceptable for:
- Baseline dust interaction testing
- Mechanism observation
- Instrumentation shakedown
- Repeatability validation

---

### 2. Controlled Enclosure or Test Box

- Enclosed volume to limit dust spread
- May include transparent walls for optical observation
- May include controlled airflow or flow suppression
- May include dust injection or disturbance mechanisms

This environment is acceptable for:
- Quantitative dust concentration measurements
- Witness surface deposition measurements
- Flow redirection visualization

The enclosure itself is considered **test infrastructure**, not part of the LDM system.

---

### 3. Reduced-Pressure or Vacuum Chamber (Optional)

If available, Phase 1 testing may include:
- Reduced-pressure testing
- Partial or full vacuum conditions

Such testing is permitted **only** to observe qualitative changes in dust behavior or mechanism response.

This environment is **not** intended to replicate:
- Lunar vacuum fidelity
- Outgassing behavior
- Radiation effects
- Long-duration vacuum exposure

Results obtained in reduced pressure are treated as exploratory only.

---

## Regolith Simulants and Dust Media

Phase 1 testing may use one or more of the following:

- Commercial lunar regolith simulants
- Crushed basalt or silicate-based powders
- Artificial dust mixtures with controlled particle size distributions

Acceptable particle size ranges include:
- Fine dust: < 20 µm
- Medium dust: 20–100 µm
- Coarser fractions as required for handling or visualization

Simulants are selected for:
- Availability
- Repeatability
- Safety

No claim is made that any simulant perfectly represents lunar regolith.

---

## Environmental Parameters (Phase 1)

The following parameters are **not controlled or simulated** unless explicitly required for a specific test:

- Reduced gravity
- Radiation environment
- Electrostatic charging from solar wind
- Micrometeoroid exposure
- Lunar day/night thermal cycling

Absence of these parameters does **not** invalidate Phase 1 testing.

---

## Explicitly Disallowed Environments

The following environments are **out of scope** for Phase 1:

- Lunar surface field testing
- Long-duration vacuum exposure (> hours)
- Thermal-vacuum cycling representative of lunar day/night
- Radiation testing
- Integrated lander or habitat environments
- Outdoor field testing intended to mimic lunar conditions

Any testing performed in these environments is **not considered Phase 1 activity**.

---

## Interpretation Limits

Results obtained in Phase 1 environments:

- Are valid only within the tested conditions
- Must not be extrapolated to lunar performance
- Must not be used to claim operational readiness

Environmental simplicity is a **deliberate design choice**, not a deficiency.

---

## Summary

Phase 1 LDM test environments are intentionally constrained to enable:

- Controlled observation
- Measurable outcomes
- Repeatable testing
- Clear failure detection

Environmental realism is explicitly deferred to future phases, if any.
