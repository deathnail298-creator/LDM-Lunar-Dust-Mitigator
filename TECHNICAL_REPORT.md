1. System Purpose

The Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM) is a passive, autonomous, multi-decadal surface module designed to condition the lunar regolith through cumulative electrostatic collision-rounding.
Its objective is not dust removal — it is dust weakening.

The system progressively reduces:

Micro-blade sharpness

Electrostatic adhesion sites

Abrasive wear characteristics

By improving the dust itself, all local infrastructure becomes easier to maintain.

2. Operational Context

Lunar regolith presents extreme hazards:

Cuts and erodes suit joints

Damages seals, optics, radiators

Infiltrates habitats

Sticks aggressively to EVA suits due to electrostatic charge

Existing systems (EDS panels, brushes, vacuums) treat the symptom.
The LDM alters the environment, generating permanent long-term improvements.

3. System Architecture (High-Level Overview)

The LDM consists of the following major subsystems:

3.1 O-Chamber (Electrostatic Collision System)

A sealed electrostatic chamber using randomized multi-directional bursts to:

Suspend regolith particles

Induce repeated high-energy micro-collisions

Chip and round particle edges

Break off micro-blades and micro-adhesion surfaces

This chamber is the core functional engine.

3.2 Tripod Deployment Platform

Designed for high-impact survivability:

Refractory shell for O₂ tank

Durable mounts for hydrogen/helium micro-tanks

Passive shock-absorbing tripod legs

Rear-facing dust ejection port

3.3 Tank System

Included to support optional utility functions:

Low-compression oxygen tank (size of a small refrigerator)

Small hydrogen & helium tanks (hand-sized)

Primary purpose: provide future contingency capability (gas-based cleaning, gas routing, thermal applications).

3.4 Onboard Battery Reserve

Used only for:

Night Mode low-frequency operation

Electronic housekeeping

Maintaining minimal system continuity

Battery is charged during lunar day.

3.5 Autonomous Deployment Chassis

Requirements:

Survive surface-drop from lander/orbital bus

Auto-righting behavior unnecessary; LDM functions regardless of orientation

Minimal mechanical complexity

4. Dust Flow Through System
4.1 Dust Intake

Dust enters through:

Astronaut movement lofting particles

Natural electrostatic lofting cycles

Vehicle activity

Micro-impacts causing localized regolith lift

Front intake includes a self-cleaning dust repulsor to prevent clogging.

4.2 Internal Processing

Particles enter the O-Chamber where they encounter:

Electrostatic bursts

Randomized directional shocks

High-frequency collisions with other grains

This “popcorn-like” agitation gradually alters dust geometry.

4.3 Dust Ejection

Processed dust exits through a passive rear opening:

Dispersed downwind

Reintegrates into local environment

Cumulative smoothing effect over months/years

5. Performance Expectations

The LDM aims for:

5.1 Target Rounding Efficiency

~20% dust rounding over long-duration operation.

This number is intentionally modest — its cumulative effect is transformative.

5.2 Local Environmental Improvement

Expected downstream improvements:

Reduced EVA suit abrasion

Reduced seal wear

Reduced radiator fouling

Lower dust adhesion on fabrics and metals

Easier habitat maintenance

Reduced optical interference

5.3 Passive, Zero-Maintenance Operation

No crew time required.
No cleaning needed.
No part replacement expected for decades.

6. Deployment Strategy
6.1 Pre-crew Deployment

LDM ideally lands before crew arrival to begin conditioning the environment immediately.

6.2 Placement Recommendations

Strategic placement yields maximum impact:

Habitat perimeters

EVA staging areas

Airlocks

Rover garages

Solar farm pathways

High-traffic regolith zones

6.3 Multi-Unit Synergy

Multiple LDM units create overlapping conditioning fields, increasing efficiency exponentially.

7. Night Mode Logic

Night mode activates only if system stored adequate energy:

Switches to low-frequency electrostatic bursts

Conserves battery life

Extends operational lifespan

Eliminates unnecessary wear

If insufficient charge exists, system enters sleep mode.

8. TRL Roadmap
8.1 Phase I (SBIR-Compatible)

Modeling & simulation

Chamber efficiency studies

Electrostatic burst optimization

Environmental stress analysis

8.2 Phase II

Prototype manufacturing

Vacuum chamber testing

Long-duration abrasion tests

Drop-impact survivability tests

8.3 TRL 7–9 (Field Deployment)

Integration into early Artemis missions

Multi-year environmental monitoring

9. Patent & Licensing

A provisional patent has been filed (details stored in /PATENT/).
All commercial variants require a 3% royalty agreement.

Licensing Summary:

Free for academic, research, and personal study

Commercial use requires signed approval

License is intentionally simple to encourage global adoption

See /LICENSE.md for details.

10. Safety & Reliability Considerations

No high-pressure systems

No hazardous exhaust

No exposed plasma or laser components

Minimal moving parts → long lifespan

Tolerant of dust accumulation

Survives drop deployment

11. Summary of Advantages
Feature	Benefit
Passive system	No crew time needed
Autonomous deployment	Works immediately on arrival
Long-duration operation	Compounding environmental gain
Dust conditioning, not removal	Changes the problem at its root
Simple design	Low failure rate
SBIR-ready	Clear commercialization pathway
Safe	No complex power systems required
12. Conclusion

The LDM is engineered for minimal complexity and maximum environmental impact.
It operates quietly, continuously, and indefinitely — slowly reshaping the lunar regolith into a friendlier form.

This is not a cleaning tool.
It is environmental engineering on a micro-scale.

A small system with a very long memory.
