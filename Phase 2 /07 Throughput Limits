# 07 — Throughput Limits

## Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM) — Phase 2 (Theory-Only)

> **Phase:** 2 (Theory)

> **Scope Rule:** This document bounds dust interception throughput using first-order reasoning only. No empirical plume models, particle simulations, test data, or performance guarantees are assumed.

## Purpose of This Document

This file answers:

> **How much dust can the Lunar Dust Mitigator plausibly intercept before diminishing returns dominate, and when does additional effort stop mattering?**

Throughput here is a *conceptual ceiling*, not a promise.

---

## Reference Assumptions

All reasoning relies solely on:

* `01_System_Assumptions.md`
* `02_Physics_Bounds.md`
* `03_Thermal_Model.md`
* `04_Power_Model.md`
* `05_Geometry_Logic.md`
* `06_Failure_Tree.md`

No new assumptions are introduced.

## Definition of Throughput

For Phase 2 purposes:

* **Throughput** = dust mass intercepted per unit time *within the local interaction zone*

This explicitly excludes:

* total site dust generation
* dust suppression
* environmental cleanup

---

## Dominant Throughput Constraints

### C1 — Geometric Cross-Section

Interception probability scales with:

* exposed frontal area
* orientation relative to dust trajectories

Upper bound:

* cannot exceed the geometric cross-section presented

---

### C2 — Trajectory Dispersion

Dust trajectories:

* are spread over angles
* vary event-to-event

Implication:

* capture probability asymptotically approaches a ceiling

---

### C3 — Accumulation Saturation

As dust accumulates:

* effective capture surfaces change
* storage volumes fill

Implication:

* marginal gains decrease over time

---

### C4 — Duty Cycle Limits

If any active behavior exists:

* it operates intermittently
* missed events are expected

Implication:

* throughput is time-averaged, not peak-based

---

## Diminishing Returns Regime

Beyond a certain point:

* increasing surface area yields smaller gains
* additional complexity increases failure risk faster than throughput

This regime begins when:

* local dust flux is no longer the limiting factor
* geometry coverage is already dominant

---

## Upper-Bound Reasoning (Conceptual)

At a first-order level:

* throughput is bounded by local dust flux × effective interception fraction
* interception fraction < 1 by definition

Perfect capture is physically impossible.

---

## Throughput Kill Conditions

The concept fails Phase 2 if it requires:

* capturing a majority of all dust generated
* precise prediction of dust events
* continuous active engagement to maintain throughput

These imply unrealistic control and power demands.

---

## Survivable Throughput Expectations

What survives Phase 2:

* partial interception
* protection of critical assets
* reduction of worst-case exposure

The goal is *mitigation*, not elimination.

---

## Phase 2 Conclusion (Throughput)

Throughput is fundamentally limited by:

* geometry
* locality
* accumulation

Meaningful mitigation is possible, but only within a bounded, diminishing-returns regime.

---

## Plain-English Summary

This document shows that the Lunar Dust Mitigator can only intercept a limited fraction of local dust and that attempting to capture everything is physically unrealistic. Throughput quickly enters a diminishing-returns regime, meaning the system’s value comes from reducing worst-case dust exposure rather than eliminating dust entirely.
