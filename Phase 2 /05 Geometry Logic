## Purpose of This Document

This file answers:

> **What geometries can intercept dust in a vacuum environment, and what geometries are structurally incapable of doing so?**

Geometry is treated as the primary control surface because:

* dust is ballistic (line-of-sight dominated)
* power is limited
* abrasion is unavoidable

---

## Reference Assumptions

All reasoning relies solely on:

* `01_System_Assumptions.md`
* `02_Physics_Bounds.md`
* `03_Thermal_Model.md`
* `04_Power_Model.md`

No new assumptions are introduced.

## Geometry Principle 1 — Line-of-Sight Interception

### Statement

If dust travels ballistically, interception requires **physical line-of-sight coverage** of likely trajectories.

### Consequences

* coverage is directional
* blind zones are guaranteed
* orientation matters

**Geometry that fails:** anything that assumes omnidirectional capture without surface area.

---

## Geometry Principle 2 — Capture Is Not Suppression

### Statement

A geometry can:

* intercept dust
* redirect dust
* absorb dust

But cannot make dust cease to exist.

### Consequences

* “capture” means accumulation somewhere
* accumulation implies saturation and/or disposal

**Geometry that fails:** designs with no accumulation volume or disposal path.

---

## Geometry Principle 3 — Abrasion Tolerance by Shape

### Statement

Since abrasion is guaranteed, geometry must avoid dependence on:

* sharp precision edges
* tight gaps
* close tolerances

### Consequences

* blunt edges win
* large clearances win
* sacrificial surfaces are acceptable

**Geometry that fails:** fine meshes with critical pore sizing or tight sliding interfaces.

---

## Geometry Principle 4 — Avoid Self-Trapping Heat

### Statement

Thermally survivable geometry must maintain:

* radiative line-of-sight to space
* non-enclosed hot cavities

### Consequences

* deep cavities can trap heat during lunar day
* fully enclosed “boxes” may overheat or create thermal cycling stress

**Geometry that fails:** closed chambers that rely on perfect insulation or active thermal control.

---

## Canonical Geometry Classes (Allowed)

These are geometry families that survive Phase 2 bounds.

### G1 — Blunt Interceptor / Baffle

* purpose: take the hit, redirect momentum
* behavior: acts like a passive “windbreak” in vacuum (ballistic shield)
* survivability: high (abrasion tolerant)

### G2 — Funnel / Collector

* purpose: increase capture probability by shaping trajectories into a volume
* behavior: trades wide entrance for smaller storage aperture
* risk: saturation, heat trapping if enclosed

### G3 — Settling Volume / Hopper

* purpose: hold intercepted dust without relying on active transfer
* behavior: gravity-assisted settling is plausible under lunar gravity (slow)
* risk: bridging and packing (treated as unknown; cannot be assumed away)

### G4 — Sacrificial Catch Surface

* purpose: accept dust deposition where it is least harmful
* behavior: a “dust sink” surface placed to protect sensitive areas
* risk: eventual burial is acceptable if non-critical

---

## Geometry Classes (Forbidden)

### X1 — Precision Filtration

* fails due to abrasion, clogging, and tolerance requirements

### X2 — Airtight Flow Channels

* fails due to vacuum dominance and lack of convective transport

### X3 — Electrostatic Capture-Only Systems

* fails due to unreliable electrostatics as a control mechanism

### X4 — High-Speed Mechanical Clearing

* fails due to power and wear; introduces moving parts as primary function

---

## Orientation Invariants

A geometry is only viable if it remains useful under:

* uncertain dust approach angles
* imperfect placement
* partial burial

Thus:

* designs should remain partially functional when misaligned
* “perfect alignment required” is a fail condition

---

## Phase 2 Conclusion (Geometry)

Geometry-dominant mitigation is feasible if it is:

* blunt
* tolerant
* local
* directional
* willing to accumulate dust

Anything requiring:

* precision gaps
* filtration
* active clearing as baseline
* electrostatic control

is killed by Phase 2 bounds.

## Plain-English Summary

This document identifies what shapes can plausibly intercept lunar dust in vacuum and what shapes cannot. Viable designs are blunt, directional, abrasion-tolerant interceptors and collectors that accept dust accumulation. Designs that rely on precision filtration, airflow channels, or electrostatic control are ruled out.
