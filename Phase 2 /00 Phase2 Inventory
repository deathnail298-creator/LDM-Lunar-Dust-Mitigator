# Phase 2 Inventory — Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)

> **Phase:** 2 (Theory‑Only)
>
> **Rule:** This inventory is the gatekeeper. Only items that can be completed **100% analytically, in‑chat, without external data, labs, simulations, hardware, or procurement** are allowed to remain.
>
> Anything that violates this rule is explicitly **crossed out** and excluded.

## How to Use This File

* This file is read **top‑to‑bottom** before any Phase 2 work begins.
* Each section below corresponds to a single Phase 2 document.
* Items are either:

  * **Included** — analytically completable
  * **Excluded (struck out)** — requires external validation or execution

No new items may be added without updating this inventory.

## Explicitly Excluded Items

The following are **not allowed** in Phase 2 and are intentionally excluded:

* ~~CFD simulations~~
* ~~DEM / particle simulations~~
* ~~Empirical dust adhesion models~~
* ~~Lab test plans~~
* ~~Field test protocols~~
* ~~Material selection optimization~~
* ~~Manufacturing methods~~
* ~~Cost models~~
* ~~Schedules or roadmaps~~
* ~~Performance claims requiring data~~

---

## Phase Discipline Check

If a question arises and the answer begins with:

* “We would need to test…”
* “We would need to simulate…”
* “We would need vendor data…”

Then the item does **not** belong in Phase 2.

## Plain‑English Summary

This file defines exactly what Phase 2 of the Lunar Dust Mitigator is allowed to contain. It permits only theory and analytical reasoning that can be completed without building, testing, or simulating anything. Anything that cannot meet that standard is explicitly excluded.
