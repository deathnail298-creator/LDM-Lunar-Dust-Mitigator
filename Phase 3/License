# Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)

## 1. Purpose

This license governs access to and use of **theory-only materials** contained in this repository section ("Phase 3"). These materials are provided solely to support reading, reasoning, critique, and conceptual exploration.

This license is intentionally **not** an open-source license.

---

## 2. Definitions

* **Theory Materials**: All documents, diagrams, calculations, text, and reasoning contained in this Phase 3 directory.
* **Execution**: Any action that applies Theory Materials to real-world activity, including but not limited to: building, prototyping, testing, simulating, manufacturing, deploying, integrating, proposing, contracting, or funding a physical or operational system.
* **Licensee**: Any individual or entity accessing or using the Theory Materials.
* **Phase 2 Execution License**: A valid, paid execution license issued for Phase 2 of this repository.

---

## 3. Permitted Uses (Free)

The following uses are permitted **without payment or additional permission**:

* Reading and reviewing the Theory Materials
* Private reasoning and internal discussion
* Academic or informal critique
* Independent verification of logic or math
* Referencing concepts at a high level without implementation

These uses do **not** authorize execution.

---

## 4. Prohibited Uses Without Execution License

The following are **explicitly prohibited** without a valid execution license:

* Building or prototyping any system described or implied
* Laboratory testing or field testing
* Simulation for the purpose of implementation
* Use in proposals, bids, grants, or contracts
* Integration into other designs or systems
* Commercial or government deployment
* Derivative works intended for execution

Intent is irrelevant; outcome controls.

---

## 5. Execution License Satisfaction

Execution rights for Phase 3 are granted under **either** of the following conditions:

* The Licensee holds a valid **Phase 3 Execution License**, **or**
* The Licensee holds a valid **Phase 2 Execution License** for this repository

A Phase 2 Execution License **automatically satisfies** the execution license requirement for Phase 3.

No additional execution fee is required for Phase 3 if Phase 2 execution rights have already been purchased.

---

## 6. Relationship to Other Phases

* Phase 0 and Phase 1 materials are governed by their own licenses
* Phase 3 does **not** expand, restrict, or modify Phase 0 / Phase 1 rights
* Phase 3 execution rights may be satisfied by Phase 2 execution licensing, as defined above

Each phase otherwise stands legally independent.

---

## 7. No Warranty

THE THEORY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

No claim is made that the materials are correct, complete, safe, feasible, or suitable for any purpose. Use is at the Licensee’s sole risk.

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE THEORY MATERIALS, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

---

## 9. Termination

This license terminates automatically upon violation of its terms.

Upon termination, all rights granted herein immediately cease.

---

## 10. Acceptance

Accessing, reading, or using the Theory Materials constitutes acceptance of this license.

If you do not agree to these terms, do not access or use the materials.
