# Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)

## Phase 3 — Pre‑Execution Theory & Closure

> **Status:** Phase 3 (Theory‑Only)
>
> **Hard Boundary:** Phase 3 still does **not** authorize building, prototyping, testing, simulation, procurement, deployment, or proposals. Execution requires a separate, explicit execution agreement.

## What Phase 3 Is

Phase 3 exists to finish *everything that can be finished without touching reality*.

If Phase 2 answered:

> “Does this violate physics or basic systems logic?”

Phase 3 answers:

> **“If we were allowed to build this later, do we fully understand what questions reality would be asked to answer?”**

Phase 3 is the last theory stop before money, hardware, and risk appear.

---

## What Phase 3 Is Not

Phase 3 is **not**:

* a prototype definition
* a test plan
* a simulation campaign
* a performance claim
* a cost estimate
* a schedule
* a proposal package
* a TRL advancement

Anyone looking for instructions, validation, or guarantees is in the wrong place.

---

## Why Phase 3 Exists

Most projects fail *between* theory and execution — not because the idea was bad, but because:

* assumptions weren’t fully enumerated
* unknowns weren’t cleanly isolated
* test dependencies were tangled
* integration risks were discovered too late

Phase 3 exists to prevent that failure mode.

It forces every remaining uncertainty into the open **before** execution is allowed.

---

## Relationship to Phase 2

Phase 3 assumes:

* Phase 2 conclusions remain valid
* no killed concepts are resurrected
* no new features are introduced

Phase 3 may only:

* sharpen boundaries
* clarify unknowns
* formalize handoff conditions

If something requires new physics or optimism, it does not belong here.

---

## Allowed Content in Phase 3

Phase 3 may contain **only** the following:

* Explicit unknown inventories
* Dependency maps (what depends on what)
* Kill‑criteria definitions
* Test *questions* (not test designs)
* Interface risk isolation
* Execution decision gates

All content must remain executable **only on paper**.

---

## Forbidden Content in Phase 3

The following are explicitly forbidden:

* Hardware drawings
* Detailed dimensions
* Material selections
* Simulation outputs
* Empirical coefficients
* Test procedures
* Validation metrics
* Optimization work
* Cost or schedule models

If it could be handed to a lab and acted on, it does not belong in Phase 3.

---

## Licensing and Execution Rights

All Phase 3 content is governed by the **Theory Exploration License (TEL‑1.0)**.

Execution rights for Phase 3 are:

* granted automatically if a Phase 2 execution license has been purchased, or
* granted via a standalone Phase 3 execution license

Reading and reasoning remain free. Execution does not.

---

## Intended Audience

Phase 3 is written for:

* senior engineers
* technical leads
* program managers
* risk and integration reviewers

It is not written for builders, hobbyists, or implementers.

## How to Read This Folder

1. Read this README first
2. Read `00_Phase3_Inventory.md`
3. Stop immediately if you are looking for execution guidance

---

## Phase Discipline Statement

Phase 3 is the **last place ambiguity is allowed**.

If a question cannot be answered here without touching hardware, it must be:

* explicitly stated
* isolated
* deferred

Nothing advances silently beyond this point.

## Plain‑English Summary

This folder contains the final theory‑only work before any real‑world execution of the Lunar Dust Mitigator. Phase 3 does not provide designs or tests; it exists to surface every remaining unknown and define exactly what would need to be validated later. It closes theory cleanly so execution, if it happens, is deliberate and bounded.
