# Phase 3 Inventory — Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)

> **Phase:** 3 (Theory-Only)
>
> **Rule:** Phase 3 exists to surface *all remaining unknowns* and define decision gates before execution. Nothing in this inventory may enable building, testing, simulation, procurement, or proposals.
>
> If an item can be acted on by a lab or workshop, it is **excluded**.

## How to Use This File

* This inventory is the controlling document for Phase 3.
* Each section corresponds to a single Phase 3 document.
* Items are either:

  * **Included** — theory-only clarification, isolation, or gating
  * **Excluded (struck out)** — execution-enabling or optimization work

No items may be added without updating this inventory.

## Included Phase 3 Work (Authoritative)

### 01 — Unknowns Registry

* Comprehensive list of unresolved questions
* Clear statement of *why* each cannot be answered analytically
* Mapping of unknowns to required real-world validation type (thermal, mechanical, dust interaction, power)

Status: **Included**

---

### 02 — Dependency & Coupling Map

* Logical dependencies between subsystems
* Identification of hidden couplings
* Separation of hard dependencies vs soft assumptions

Status: **Included**

---

### 03 — Kill Criteria Definition

* Explicit conditions under which execution should be terminated
* Go / No-Go logic framed without test procedures
* Early-failure preference codified

Status: **Included**

---

### 04 — Test Question Set (Not Test Plans)

* Precise questions reality must answer
* Ordering of questions by risk
* Clear distinction between validation vs optimization questions

Status: **Included**

---

### 05 — Interface Risk Isolation

* Identification of interface-driven execution risks
* Conditions under which interfaces become unsafe or unacceptable
* Explicit non-interfaces reaffirmed

Status: **Included**

---

### 06 — Execution Decision Gates

* Criteria required to advance beyond theory
* Minimum evidence thresholds (qualitative)
* Conditions for pause, redesign, or abandonment

Status: **Included**

---

## Explicitly Excluded Items

The following are **not allowed** in Phase 3:

* ~~Hardware drawings or CAD~~
* ~~Detailed dimensions or tolerances~~
* ~~Material selection or trade studies~~
* ~~Simulation models or results~~
* ~~Test procedures or setups~~
* ~~Performance targets or metrics~~
* ~~Cost estimates or schedules~~
* ~~Procurement strategies~~
* ~~Manufacturing approaches~~
* ~~Optimization of any kind~~

## Phase 3 Discipline Check

If a proposed item:

* reduces uncertainty by *doing* something,
* narrows design choices prematurely,
* or could be handed to an engineer to build,

then it does **not** belong in Phase 3.

---

## Relationship to Phase 2

* Phase 3 may not contradict Phase 2 conclusions
* Phase 3 may not resurrect killed concepts
* Phase 3 exists only because Phase 2 closed cleanly

If Phase 2 were incomplete, Phase 3 would be invalid.

## Plain-English Summary

This file defines exactly what Phase 3 of the Lunar Dust Mitigator is allowed to contain. Phase 3 does not design or test anything; it exposes remaining unknowns, dependencies, and decision gates so execution, if approved later, is deliberate and bounded. Anything that enables building or optimization is intentionally excluded.
