This directory provides all subsystem-level engineering descriptions, dimensional placeholders, interface specifications, and CAD-ready structural outlines for future mechanical drawings.
It is structured to allow aerospace partners to immediately begin CAD modeling, materials selection, and survivability testing.

2. High-Level Schematic Summary

This section describes the mechanical layout in words — this is the equivalent of a "pre-CAD drawing" that mechanical engineers use to generate solids models.

2.1 Overall Form Factor

Footprint: tripod base, roughly 1.5–2.0 m diameter

Height: 1.2–1.6 m, depending on tank placement

Center of mass: low, intentionally stable

Orientation-agnostic operation: works even if it lands sideways

2.2 Module Layout

From top-down:

[TOP HOUSING]
    Battery
    Burst-controller electronics
    Thermal shield

[MID CORE]
    O-Chamber (sealed)
    Electrode grid layers
    Dust agitation chamber
    Rear ejection aperture

[BOTTOM]
    Tripod legs
    Tank assembly (O₂, H₂, He)
    Impact shock absorption interface

3. O-Chamber (Electrostatic Collision System)
Function

Random electrostatic bursts energize grains, forcing chaotic collisions to “round” micro-blades over time.

Internal Architecture

Geometry: cylindrical or spherical

Electrode array: multi-directional grid

Coating: insulating refractory ceramic

Burst timing: randomized, pseudo-noise pattern

Particle capture: 30–50 µm regolith target range

Subsystem Files

O_CHAMBER_OVERVIEW.md

ELECTROSTATIC_GRID_LAYOUT.md

BURST_PATTERN_LOGIC.md

DUST_FLOW_INTERNAL.md

4. Tripod Platform
Function

Survive 3–6 m/s impact, maintain stability, provide mounting points.

Material Candidates

Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy

Carbon fiber composite

Sintered regolith-based ceramic (experimental)

Subsystem Files

STRUCTURAL_FRAME.md

IMPACT_SURVIVABILITY.md

MOUNT_INTERFACE_POINTS.md

5. Tank System
Oxygen Tank

Size: “mini-fridge” class

Pressure: low-compression (50–150 psi)

Purpose: contingency utility for future mission needs

Hydrogen/Helium Tanks

Palm-sized

Stored as optional micro-reserves

Subsystem Files

OXYGEN_TANK_SPEC.md

HYDROGEN_TANK_SPEC.md

HELIUM_TANK_SPEC.md

THERMAL_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS.md

6. Power System
Battery Module

Chemistry: LiFePO₄ or solid-state

Power budget:

Daytime: 100% O-Chamber operation

Night: 10–20% low-frequency bursts

Subsystem Files

BATTERY_MODULE_SPEC.md

ENERGY_BUDGET_DAY_NIGHT.md

NIGHT_MODE_PROTOCOL.md

7. Dust Flow Schematic
Stages

Intake
Dust lofted by astronaut boots, rovers, or micrometeorites enters front aperture.

Internal Processing
Agitation bursts → collision cycles → micro-blade removal.

Rear Exhaust
Rounded dust is expelled passively into the environment.

Subsystem Files

FRONT_INTAKE.md

SELF_CLEANING_REPULSOR.md

INTERNAL_PATHWAYS.md

REAR_EJECTION_PORT.md

8. Autonomous Deployment Chassis
Design Priorities

Survive drop

Minimal moving parts

No righting mechanisms

Function regardless of landing orientation

Subsystem Files

DROP_SURVIVABILITY_DESIGN.md

ORIENTATION-INDEPENDENT_OPERATION.md

LANDER_INTERFACE_SPEC.md

9. CAD Integration Notes

These notes tell aerospace partners exactly what they need to begin modeling:

All file names map 1:1 to CAD subsystem assemblies

Dimensions are given as ranges to allow iterative optimization

Material lists included at subsystem level

Interfaces are explicitly modular

No proprietary geometry constraints are imposed

10. Status

Current phase: Pre-CAD, engineering documentation foundation complete.
Next phase: Populate subsystem files, then produce CAD solids and FEA analysis.
