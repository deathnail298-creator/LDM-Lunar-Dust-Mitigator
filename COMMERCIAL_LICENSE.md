# LDM Commercial Use Terms

This repository and its contents are provided freely for **non-commercial** use:
research, education, critique, internal simulation work, and lab testing.

If you use the Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM) concept **commercially** – for example:

- As part of a product you sell or license,
- As part of a mission, payload, or service for which you are paid,
- As the core of an internal system that directly generates revenue,

then the following simple royalty applies:

> **3% (three percent) of gross revenue derived from LDM-based products or services.**

Where “LDM-based” means:
- You use the LDM architecture, deployment concept, dust-rounding approach, or
- You rely materially on the designs, budgets, or theory described in this repo.

### How to comply

1. Email the author with a short description of how you are using LDM and expected revenue.
2. Agree on a simple reporting cadence (e.g., quarterly or annually).
3. Pay the agreed 3% royalty on LDM-derived revenue for as long as you use it.

If you are:
- A university or public research lab doing **non-commercial** work,
- A student project,
- An unfunded or purely academic simulation effort,

then these commercial terms do **not** apply. You can use the material under the
standard open-source license in `LICENSE`.

These terms are intentionally simple; they are meant to make collaboration easy,
not to trap anyone in legalese. If your situation is unusual, contact the author
to work out a bespoke agreement.
