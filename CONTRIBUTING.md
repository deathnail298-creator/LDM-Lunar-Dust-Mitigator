# Contributing to the Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)

Thanks for taking the time to look at LDM.

This project is currently focused on:
- Stress-testing the concept,
- Improving the physics and engineering assumptions,
- Making it easier for labs to simulate and prototype.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue**
   - If you see a technical flaw, missing constraint, or unclear assumption,
     open an issue with:
     - What you think is wrong or missing,
     - Any data, papers, or calculations you are basing it on,
     - Suggested corrections or experiments.

2. **Propose changes via pull request**
   - Fork the repo.
   - Make your edits in a separate branch.
   - Keep changes narrowly focused (one topic per PR if possible).
   - Explain in the PR description:
     - What you changed,
     - Why you changed it,
     - Any open questions you still have.

3. **Keep the mission in mind**
   - LDM is explicitly:
     - Long-term, cumulative,
     - Low-power, low-maintenance,
     - A “background” dust-mitigation tool, not a silver bullet.
   - Contributions that try to turn it into a high-power, immediate-effect system
     are off-scope for this repo.

## Code of conduct

Use basic professional standards:
- No harassment or personal attacks.
- Argue data and assumptions, not people.
- If a discussion gets stuck, propose an experiment or test that could resolve it.
