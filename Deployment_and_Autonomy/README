# Deployment & Autonomous Operation  
### Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM)

This folder contains the deployment logic, autonomous decision flows, and operational lifecycle behavior for the Lunar Dust Mitigator (LDM).  
It defines how the system transitions from orbital delivery → surface deployment → autonomous long-duration operation with no human intervention.

---

## 🚀 1. Deployment Overview

The LDM is designed for **fully autonomous deployment** from an orbital or surface-delivery vehicle.  
No astronauts, technicians, or robotic arms are required.

Deployment includes:

1. **Release from lander/orbiter** (drop, push-off, or eject)
2. **Impact-tolerant landing**
3. **Tripod stabilization & settling**
4. **Power-on initialization**
5. **Sensor wake cycle**
6. **Begin passive dust-rounding operation**

The system is designed so that *any correct orientation is survivable*.  
If deployed upside-down, side-tilted, or partially buried, the structure self-rights or defaults into passive mode.

## 🧠 2. Autonomy Philosophy

The LDM follows the core principle:

> **Fail Passive, Operate Forever.**

Meaning:

- If any component fails → system keeps running.
- If sensors degrade → fallback to passive operation.
- If power drops → low-frequency night mode takes over.
- No single failure mode stops dust rounding.

Zero human intervention required for multi-decadal timelines.

## 🔋 3. Power Logic (Day/Night Mode)

### **Day Mode (Primary Operation)**
- Solar input available  
- Full O-Machine electrostatic activity  
- Higher burst-frequency for dust collisions  
- Charge equalization cycles  
- Open-back dust exhaust remains fully active  

### **Night Mode (Optional Low-Frequency Mode)**
- Activated only if **energy surplus exists**  
- Burst rate scaled down  
- Prioritizes component longevity  
- Never drains battery below survival threshold  

If night mode cannot run, the system simply becomes inert until sunrise.

## 📡 4. Sensor Logic (Minimalist Robust Design)

Sensors include:

- **Photoelectric / ambient light detection**  
- **Charge buildup sensors**  
- **Thermal sensors** (health, throttling)  
- **Simple dust ingress counters** (optional)

### Core Rules:
- Sensor failure **never halts operation**  
- Only four decisions exist:
  1. Run full mode  
  2. Run reduced-frequency mode  
  3. Idle  
  4. Safety discharge cycle (electrostatic reset)

## 🔁 5. Operational Flowchart

### **Simplified Logic**

BOOT →
Check Battery →
If < threshold: Idle until solar recovery →
If ≥ threshold: Run Day Mode →
Monitor Sensors →
If Overcharge: Run discharge cycle →
If Overheat: Cooldown Idle →
If Dust Jam: Reverse pulse / self-clear →
Else: Continue rounding →
Loop Forever

This architecture is intentionally simple — fewer failure states = more decades of reliable operation.

## 🛡️ 6. Survivability Features

- **Impact-tolerant frame**  
- **Self-cleaning front electrostatic repulsor**  
- **Open-back ejection chamber prevents clogging**  
- **Only one movable subsystem: electrostatic cycling**  
- **No bearings, belts, fans, or mechanical wear parts**  
- **Redundant grounding paths prevent capacitor runaway**  

System is designed for:

- regolith storms  
- micrometeoroid pitting  
- thermal cycles (−170°C to +120°C)  
- electrostatic overcharge  
- multi-year dust accumulation

## 🌙 7. Long-Term Behavior (10–30 Years)

Over decades the LDM:

- Gradually rounds sharp particles  
- Lowers environmental abrasiveness  
- Reduces regolith adhesion to everything  
- Improves astronaut suit life  
- Reduces wear on rover joints, optics, seals  
- Softens surfaces near habitats and ingress zones  

Performance goal:  
**~20% rounding effectiveness**, accumulating over years of continuous presence.
